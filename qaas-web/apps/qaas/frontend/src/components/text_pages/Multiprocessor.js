            <p>
                QaaS covers multiprocessing (MP) in the form of both throughput and parallelism, but only in the HPC context of getting one problem solved.
                It does not deal with many-problem throughput (which is usually the domain of cost, job scheduling  and OS management).
                We discuss two broad topics: compilation 1.1 and scalability, separately and in that order.
