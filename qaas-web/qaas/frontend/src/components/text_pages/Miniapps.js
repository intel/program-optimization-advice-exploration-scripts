                (DKdecide how to include SKL and SPR, etc.)
                are discussed here; first the best compiler, then the benefits of QaaS are explained.
                The best compiler per miniapp is simply the compiler for which QaaS found a flag setting whose performance beat
                all others; 48 cases were tested â€“ the 3 compilers above with16 flag settings each, see Fig. bestcomp.
                We can see that all 3 compilers are necessary in this multi-compilation result, with GCC winning on Kripke,
                while ICC and ICX win in 2 other cases, each. The 2 tie cases have times within 10% of each other on all 3 compilers.
            </p>
            <p>
                From 16 to 48 cores per code were used to obtain total Gf and Gf/core on this ICL system, to exceed an efficiency threshold of 50%.

            <p>
                At a high level, ISVs and multi-app developers, or CSPs and computer managers,
                are mostly interested in compiler choice outcomes based on performance gains,denominated in numbers of codes.
                Here, a baseline compiler suggested by the developer or chosen by QaaS experts is compared with all other QaaS runs.
                For these 7 miniapps, the QaaS benefits can be summarized (see Table appgain), as 2 ties,
                and various numbers of codes with up to more than 4X performance gains for the C++ version of Cloverleaf.
