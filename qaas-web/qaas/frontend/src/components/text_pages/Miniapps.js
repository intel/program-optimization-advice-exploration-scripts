                The overall QaaS results for 7 miniapps run on Intel Ice Lake [Yue reference syst def] are discussed here.
                First the best compiler, then the benefits of QaaS are explained. The best compiler per miniapp is simply the
                compiler for which QaaS found a flag setting that beat all others; 48 cases were tested here â€“
                3 compilers with 16 flag settings each, see Fig. bestcomp.

                A.    At a high level, ISVs and multi-app developers, or CSPs and computer managers,
                are mostly interested in outcomes denominated in numbers of codes. Here we use 7 miniapps,
                and the QaaS benefits can be summarized (see Table appgain), as 2 ties, and various numbers of codes with up to more than 4X performance gains.
