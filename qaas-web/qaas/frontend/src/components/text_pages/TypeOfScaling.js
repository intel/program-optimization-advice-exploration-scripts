            <p>
                The y-axis is perf Gf or FOM and x-axis shows replication factors from 1 (strong scaling) to p (throughput), with points for interesting variations
                (e.g. logarithmic) between – these hybrid or weak cases would show OMP vs MPI counts.
                Recall Jan documents laying this out in detail – also get scalability defs. for Definition bar.
