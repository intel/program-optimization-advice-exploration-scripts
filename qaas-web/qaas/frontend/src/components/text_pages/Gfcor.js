                i.e. different models from one or
                more manufacturers. ALL: gather previous runs now for joint graphs (HM has Intel, WJ has Intel, AMD, ARM)
                We use unique colors for each arch type win – dummy names here, no colors chosen. The controlled variable here is the applications – including their domains/
